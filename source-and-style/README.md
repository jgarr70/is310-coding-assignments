# Inspecting the Cultural Web

*website:* https://www.crusadeforthevote.org/primary-documents-1

I inspected the primary documents tab in Crusade for the Vote. 

**Web Technologies**

Squarespace was used to make this website. It's hard to see the exact .html, .css, .js files because it was on Squarespace. There's a lot of .js assets I don't recongnize. 

**Website Builder**

The National Women's History Museum is the one backs *crusadeforthevote.org*, so they must've created this website as well. Since this was created on Squarespace there most likley isn't a github for this.
